* Question: For cases 3 and 4 in Section 1.5, list the possible predictor variables that might be useful, assuming that the relevant data are available.
    * Responses
        * Case 3: company wants to forecast retail values of fleet vehicles after 3-year leases.
            * Prompt, "What affects resale values?"
                * Supply and demand for used cars in the market versus new
                * Condition of leased cars to be sold
                * How long company can hold onto inventory to optimize for change in possible price
        * Case 4: "weekly air passenger traffic on major domestic routes for one of Australiaâ€™s leading airlines"
            * Overall state of economy
                * Interest rates
                * Tourism demand
            * Regularly recurring holidays and events per locality of interest--locality being city or area of departure and arrival airports
            * Service capacity of competing airlines
            * Consumer gasoline prices (if it's cheaper to drive, maybe people will fly less)
* Question: For case 3 in Section 1.5, describe the five steps of forecasting in the context of this project.
    * Response
        * 5 steps (case 3)
            1. Problem definition
                * the way the forecasts will be used
                * who requires the forecasts
                * how the forecasting function fits within the organisation requiring the forecasts
            2. Gathering information
                * historical statistical data
                * accumulated expertise of the people who collect the data and use the forecasts
            3. Preliminary (exploratory) analysis
                * Start by graphing the data
                * Ask if there consistent patterns or significant trends
                * Ask if there are seasonal patterns or trends
                * Ask if there are patterns related to business cycles
                * Are there outliers in the data requiring expert insight
                * Try to identify any relationships between variables
            4. Choosing and fitting models
                * Consider availability of historical data
                * Consider strengths
                * Consider 
                * Consider 
                * Consider 
            5. Using and evaluating a forecasting model
