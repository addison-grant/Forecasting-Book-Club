1. Use the help function to explore what the series gafa_stock, PBS, vic_elec and pelt represent.
  a. Use autoplot() to plot some of the series in these data sets.
  b. What is the time interval of each series?

```{r}
?gafa_stock
gs <- gafa_stock %>% update_tsibble(index = Date)
gafa_stock %>% distinct(Symbol)
?autoplot
gafa_stock %>% autoplot
```

```{r}
?PBS
head(PBS)
PBS %>% autoplot
PBS %>% 
  select(Month, Type, Scripts) %>% 
  pivot_longer(values_from=Scripts, names_from=Type)
```

```{r}
?vic_elec

```

```{r}
?pelt
```


```{r}
# (a) You can read the data into R with the following script:
tute1 <- readr::read_csv("tute1.csv")
head(tute1)
```
```{r}
View(tute1)
```

```{r}
# (b) Convert the data to time series
mytimeseries <- tute1 %>% 
  mutate(Quarter = yearmonth(Quarter)) %>% 
  as_tibble(index = Quarter)

mytimeseries
```
```{r}
# (c) Construct time series plots of each of the three series
mytimeseries %>%
  pivot_longer(-Quarter) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(name ~ ., scales = "free_y")
```
```{r}
mytimeseries %>%
  pivot_longer(-Quarter)
```
```{r}
# (c, cont.) Check what happens when you donâ€™t include facet_grid().
mytimeseries %>%
  pivot_longer(-Quarter) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line()
```
