Quote: "Graphs enable many features of the data to be visualised, including patterns, unusual observations, changes over time, and relationships between variables"

```{r load libraries, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(fpp3)
```

```{r first tsibble example}
y <- tsibble(
  Year = 2015:2019,
  Observation = c(123, 39, 78, 52, 110),
  index = Year
)
y
```


<!-- ## Examples Rmd code: -->

<!-- ```{r setup, include=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## R Markdown -->

<!-- This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. -->

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
